# Pig Latin Translator - Skye Nguyen

##### By Skye Nguyen, Meria Thomas and Hyewon Cho

### Description

The Pig Latin translator takes in a sentence, apply one of the rules below and return the translated sentence. 

#### How Pig Latin Works

* For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

* For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

* If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

* For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
